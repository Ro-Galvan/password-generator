# Description

The deployed website allows a user to auto-generate a password. They are able to select from as many of the below options  
   - password between 8-128 characters in length
   - lowercase 
   - uppercase
   - numbers
   - special characters  

This takes the hassle out of thinking of a password and if ***all** the options are selected then it will be a ***strong*** password, making it more secure. These days users' search engines are able to remember the password so passwords don't need to be words or phrases that are easy and remember. So give it a try and start using this website generator!
